# Website Dashboard

This is a Dashboard website template that I did not finish.

# Installation

Firstly, You need to import it into the project do this by running the command `git clone https://github.com/NotKeira/old-website-dashboard.git`

Secondly, you need to run `cd old-website-dashboard` (This is optional, however you MUST pull the files out of this folder if you choose not to do it)

Thirdly, you need to install it's dependencies, do this by running `npm i`

And now you're done.
